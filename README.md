The Politicians Library
=======================
This is an angularjs project that provides information about the top fundraising politicians every election year and their top contributors. Data comes from the [Sunlight Influence Explorer API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/datacommons/index.html). There is only data available from 1990 onward. Please visit the [site](http://lobby-info.herokuapp.com/).

Cloning the project
-------------------
If you wish to run the project yourself, you must obtain an API key from the [Sunlight Influence Explorer API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/datacommons/index.html). That key has to be set as an environment variable. If you are running the application locally with node, use the command `apiKey=[your api key here] node app.js`.
